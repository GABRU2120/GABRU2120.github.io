        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>1. Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. I implemented various machine learning algorithms and evaluated them based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was deployed for real-time fraud detection, achieving a high accuracy rate in detecting fraudulent transactions and significantly reducing false positives.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>2. House Price Prediction using Regression Models</h3>
            <p>In this project, I built a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features using regression techniques. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge. I performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models, and the final model accurately predicted house prices, assisting real estate agents in making informed decisions.</p>
